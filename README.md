# Amazon Vine Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to help Big Market optimize their clients marketing efforts. $ellBy is a company that is about to release a large catalog of products on a major retail website. We are going to assist $ellBy in analyzing their product reviews and compare the reviews to those of their competitorâ€™s similar products. $ellBy is also interested in a paid membership program that gives out free products to select reviewers and wants to know if it would be worth the cost. 


## Results

* There are 40471 unpaid non-Vine account reviews

##Summary

It is difficult to say if there is any positivity bias in the reviews due to the large difference in numbers between the Vine and non-Vine reviews. There were only 98 Vine reviews compared to 40,471 non-Vine reviews. Each Vine review was worth 1.06% of the total score and just a few members changing their star rating could have a dramatic impact on the overall score. While each non-Vine review was only worth 0.002% of the total score. The non-Vine sample was over 400X larger than the Vine sample. This is not an ideal comparison. Without considering the size difference it seems as though there is a slight positivity bias amongst members as 12.36% more reviews were given a rating of five stars. However, if just 11 Vine members had given a Four-star review instead then the overall Five Star percentage would have been the same. 
I would like to do another comparison with all One Star reviews for both Vine and non-Vine members. This would tell us if there were any extremely unhappy reviewers and if there was a larger percentage among Vine or non-Vine members.
